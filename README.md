# Ticket Coin Application


Ticket Coin Application is a decentralized ticketing system built on the Solana blockchain. It enables the creation and verification of NFT tickets for events, ensuring the authenticity and security of tickets while providing a seamless entry process for users.

The Ticket Coin Application consists of two main components:

Ticket Coin Application: This is the application responsible for creating NFT tickets and managing event details. It allows event organizers to issue tickets as NFTs on the Solana blockchain, with each ticket representing a unique and verifiable digital asset.

TicketCoin Verifier App: This application is used by event staff or ticketing personnel to verify the authenticity of NFT tickets. By scanning the QR code or entering the ticket details, the app communicates with the Solana blockchain to ensure that the ticket is valid and has not been tampered with.

# Features
Creation of NFT Tickets: Event organizers can create NFT tickets for their events, defining the event details, ticket types, pricing, and other relevant information.

Secure Ticket Distribution: NFT tickets are securely distributed to ticket buyers, ensuring that each ticket is associated with a unique wallet address.

Verifiable Authenticity: The TicketCoin Verifier App verifies the authenticity of NFT tickets by interacting with the Solana blockchain, ensuring that the ticket has not been duplicated or tampered with.

Entry Verification: Event staff can use the TicketCoin Verifier App to scan the QR code or manually enter the ticket details to validate the ticket and grant entry to the event.
